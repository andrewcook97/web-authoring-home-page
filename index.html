<p>This first project of the year started us off by teaching us basic code as well as the importance of responsive web design.<p>

	</div>
	<p>Project 2 had us creating a page to show off everything a typeface of our choice had to offer, as well as getting us in the practice of using web safe fonts and getting our content development down before worrying about layout design. I chose Arial as my web safe font.<p>

<p>Our third and final project of the year was meant to take everything we learned and put it all together. We were allowed to create a short sweet website with the topic and content of our own choosing. I chose to create a gallery stile collective of a specific line of work I have done over the past few years that I call Time's Up.<p>
